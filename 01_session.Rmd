```

## Agenda

* Getting familiar with the RStudio IDE
* Using RStudio Projects
* Importing data from an Excel file
* Introducing `ggplot2` to create data visualizations

<!-- ## Script -->

<!-- Here's the script from Session 1. You should download this and save it inside the R Project folder that you created for this workshop. -->

<!--to add scripts -->

<!-- ```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE} -->

<!-- # install and load these packages -->
<!-- devtools::install_github('yihui/xfun') -->

<!-- # embed_file() requires a few more packages -->
<!-- xfun::pkg_load2(c('base64enc', 'htmltools', 'mime')) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- # a embed single file -->
<!-- xfun::embed_file('session_01.R') -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Resources
A nice review of the RStudio IDE and R Projects:

The introduction to data visualization we will cover today is based off of Chapter 3 (sections 3.1 - 3.3) in the R4DS textbook: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html

## Exercises

No exercises for this week, but I recommend going through the script from this session yourself and practice predicting what the code will generate before running it.
